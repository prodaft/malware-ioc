# PTI-257 Group Indicators of Compromise (IOC)

These IOCs were released as part of PTI team research.

PTI-257 consists of former Wizard Spider actors who are publicly known for the various malware variants they use (Ryuk, Trickbot, and Conti, among others). It is a financially motivated cybercrime group first identified in 2017. It may be one of the wealthiest groups currently in operation, with total assets easily over hundreds of millions of dollars. The PTI team has been actively tracking the Wizard Spider group since releasing our first public report in November 2021. This prevented hundreds of ransomware attacks and notified over 100,000 victims, including defence and aerospace companies, food producers, supply chain providers, hospitals, government agencies, and critical infrastructure providers. These IP addresses are part of the infrastructure from the former members, currently designated as PTI 257, that currently use LockBit Ransomware to encrypt the computers of corporate networks with a ransom demand.
